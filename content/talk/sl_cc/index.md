abstract: Kat will discuss ensemble machine learning in R. Ensemble models combine multiple models to create a stronger overall prediction model. She will give an overview of ensemble learning methods and the packages available in R. She will then focus on understanding and using one algorithm for ensemble learning â€“ stacking, or superlearning.
