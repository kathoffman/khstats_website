<p>Developing and optimizing <strong>individualized treatment rules (ITRs)</strong> is a fast-growing topic in the medical research community. A treatment rule is a <strong>decision for treatment based upon a person‚Äôs characteristics</strong>. The intuition behind this is that not all individuals will respond to a treatment in the same way. We can exploit these <strong>heterogeneous effects</strong> and develop personalized rules which provide benefit a greater number of people.</p>
<p>The methods of ITRs are rooted in <strong>principles of causal inference</strong>, or using data to inform us about what would have happened in a hypothetical world in which different interventions had occurred. This post walks through the basic statistical intuition for ITRs. Each explanation is accompanied by mathematical notation and a small graphic to convey equivalent meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although this post is introductory, it assumes basic knowledge in causal inference, such as <em>counterfactual outcomes</em>, <em>assumptions for causal identification</em>, <em>Average Treatment Effect</em>, and <a href="https://github.com/kathoffman/causal-inference-visual-guides/blob/master/visual-guides/G-Computation.pdf"><em>G-computation</em>/<em>g-formula</em></a>.</p>

<h1>üó∫Ô∏è The Big Picture of ITRs</h1>
<p>In this first section, we will translate the concept of developing and optimizing an ITR into mathematical notation.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We will start with a standard set-up: we have a matrix of observed data <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> which includes our <strong>outcome</strong> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, the <strong>exposure</strong> (i.e.¬†treatment, medicine, etc.) we want to study <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and other <strong>covariates</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{W}\)</span>. Each row is an observation. We can denote these columns of data, which are random variables, as <span class="math inline">\(O = (\textbf{W}, A, Y)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ![](/img/tmle/1_data_structure.png){width=80%} -->
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now, consider we create some function, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, which takes baseline confounders <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{W}\)</span> and outputs a treatment assignment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. We can write this mapping function, or <strong>treatment rule</strong>, in mathematical notation as:</li>
</ol>
<!-- <p style="margin-left: 40px"> -->
<p><span class="math display">\[d: \textbf{W} \rightarrow A\]</span>
This is equivalent to a function you could write in R or Python which takes a matrix <code>W</code> and outputs a vector of treatment assignments <code>A</code>, which may or may not be the same treatment assignment as what each observation actually received.</p>

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- d <- function(W){ -->
<!--   # assigned treatment A is a vector of length nrow(W) and depends on values of W -->
<!--   # for example, the treatment rule could be if W1 is greater than 5, treat, otherwise, don't treat -->
<!--   A <- ifelse(W[[1]] > 5, 1, 0) -->
<!--   return(A) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can then think about the <strong>counterfactual outcome</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for each row, or observation, under the treatment rule <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.

<h1>üìà Estimating the ITR</h1>
<p>There are many ways to estimate <span class="math inline">\(d^*\)</span>. One of the most common ways begins by estimating the <strong>Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)</strong>.</p>
<p>You have probably heard of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which is the mean difference in outcomes in a world in which every unit receives the exposure compared to a world in which no unit receives the exposure. In potential outcomes notation, <span class="math inline">\(ATE = \mathrm{E}[Y^1-Y^0]\)</span>. The CATE is the same formula and description, but within covariate strata <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[CATE = \mathrm{E}[Y^1-Y^0|\textbf{W}]\]</span></p>
<p>Under standard causal assumptions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, the CATE for a binary exposure is identifiable under the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{CATE}(W) = \mathrm{E}[Y|A=1, \textbf{W}] - \mathrm{E}[Y|A=0, \textbf{W}]\]</span>
<!-- Compare this to the ATE after identification to clearly see the formula for CATE is the same, minus the outer expectation: --></p>
<!-- $$\mathrm{ATE}(W) = \mathrm{E}[\mathrm{E}[Y|A=1, W] - \mathrm{E}[Y|A=0, W]]$$ -->
<p>We could estimate the CATE using <strong>G-computation</strong><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fit a regression for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E}[Y|A,\textbf{W}]\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/tmle/2_outcome_fit.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the model fit from Step 1 to obtain predicted estimates for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Use two different datasets: one where all observations are changed to have <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>, and one where all observations are changed to have <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{E}[Y|A=1, \textbf{W}]\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/img/tmle/4_Q1.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{E}[Y|A=0, \textbf{W}]\]</span></p>

<p><img src="/img/otr/cate.png" style="width:32.0%" /></p>
<p>Now, we could say our optimal ITR is to <strong>give treatment if the value of <span class="math inline">\(CATE\)</span> for that person is positive</strong>, indicating a positive effect of treatment on the outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Likewise, if the value is negative or 0, indicating a negative or neutral effect on the outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, that unit would not receive treatment under the ITR.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ITR = \mathbb{1}{ \{CATE &gt; 0} \}\]</span></p>

<div id="r-simulation" class="section level1">
<h1>üñ•Ô∏è <code>R</code> simulation</h1>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look an <code>R</code> simulation for the simple estimation of the <span class="math inline">\(d^*\)</span> we just described. We can first simulate data of <code>n</code> = 500 rows, where we have only one confounder <code>W</code>, a binary treatment <code>A</code> which depends on <code>W</code>, and an outcome <code>Y</code> which is continuous and depends on <code>W</code> and <code>A</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n &lt;- 500
W &lt;- runif(n, 1, 99)
A &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, prob = abs(W/100))
Y &lt;- rnorm(n, 10) + rnorm(n, 2*A) + rnorm(n, 50*W) - rnorm(n, .1*A*W)
df &lt;- data.frame(W, A, Y)</code></pre>
<p>We‚Äôll run a regression for a saturated linear regression model of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{E}[Y|A,\textbf{W}]\)</span>, then obtain predictions on datasets where <code>A</code> is changed to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> for all rows. We can then compute the CATE as the difference between these predictions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fit &lt;- glm(Y~A*W)
E_Y1 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(A = 1, W))
E_Y0 &lt;- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(A = 0, W))
CATE &lt;- E_Y1 - E_Y0</code></pre>
<p>Finally, our optimal treatment rule will be to treat any unit with <code>CATE &gt; 1</code>. If we plot the distribution of CATE in intervals of length 1, we can visually see there is benefit for about 1/4 of units in our simulated population.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

data.frame(CATE) |&gt;
  mutate(d_star = ifelse(CATE &gt; 0, &quot;Treat&quot;, &quot;Do not treat&quot;)) |&gt;

<h1>Improving estimation of <span class="math inline">\(d^*\)</span></h1>
<p>There are many other ways to estimate the <span class="math inline">\(CATE\)</span> with improved statistical properties, e.g.¬†<strong>double robustness</strong>. We could also estimate <span class="math inline">\(d^*\)</span> directly instead of first estimating the <span class="math inline">\(CATE\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can extend either of these ideas to longitudinal settings, studies with clustering, etc. I‚Äôve listed some of the resources I‚Äôve used to learn about optimizing ITRs below. As always, I welcome feedback and/or suggestions of additional resources I can include.</p>
