This post provides **examples of Static, Dynamic, and Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs)** for point (as opposed to time-varying) exposures using the open source R package `lmtp`. The examples include:
 
1. [Binary exposure, continuous outcome, static intervention]
2. [Binary expsoure, dynamic intervention]
3. Continuous exposure, modified treatment policy

If you're not sure what the differences between these types of interventions are, check out Part 1: Introduction and Motivation.

# General Data Preparation Notes

You'll want your data to be friendly to machine learning algorithms. This includes:

- Creating dummy variables for categorical variables

- Deciding on methods for missingness (e.g. mean substitution, multiple imputation, etc.)


# Setup

I usually use the `lmtp` package which is compatible with the superlearning ensemble package `sl3`. Although `lmtp` is on CRAN, `sl3` is not (and prevents `lmtp`'s `sl3`-compatible version from being on CRAN), so you have to download the `sl3`-compatible version of `lmtp` directly from Github.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("nt-williams/lmtp@sl3") # uncomment to install
library(lmtp)
```



# Static Treatment Policies

As we learned in Part 1, static treatment policies, or interventions, set every observation's hypothetical exposure to the same value.

There are many scientific questions we can think of to answer.

Let's use toy data on N=2000 patients 

```{r}

```
