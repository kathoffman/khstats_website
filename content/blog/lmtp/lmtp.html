<h1>TLDR</h1>
<ul>
<li>Modified Treatment Policies are a collection of methods for <strong>defining</strong> and <strong>operationalizing</strong> interesting <strong>causal inference questions</strong>.</li>
<li>The unifying theme in this collection of methods is that they allow us to study hypothetical interventions, or treatment policies, that are <strong>extremely flexible</strong>.</li>
<li>This flexibility enables us to <strong>answer more realistic scientific questions</strong> in both <strong>cross-sectional and longitudinal settings</strong>, with <strong>multivariate, categorical, or continuous exposures</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Lastly, before I begin, please note a few sets of words I’ll use interchangeably: -->
<!-- - Exposure and treatment -->
<!-- - Treatment policy and intervention -->

<p>Most modern causal inference methods utilize the <strong>potential outcomes framework</strong>, which asks questions of <strong>what would happen</strong> in a <strong>hypothetical world</strong> in which we could <strong>manipulate exposures</strong> and then <strong>compare outcomes for the same observations under different exposures</strong>.</p>
<p>Questions with binary exposures typically take the form, “<strong>what would happen if everyone had received the exposure compared to if no one had received the exposure</strong>?” Similarly, questions with multi-level or continuous exposures often take the form “what would happen if everyone had received <em>this much</em> of the exposure, versus if everyone had received <em>that much</em> of the exposure?” Study designs like this which compare all observations under two (or more) specific levels of exposure are called <strong>static interventions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Static interventions are a common approach in causal inference, but a few problems frequently arise.</h2>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;">
Problem #1: Positivity Violations
</h3>
<p>A key requirement for causal inference is the <strong>positivity assumption</strong>. This means if you are comparing two exposures (say, treatments A vs. B), <strong>for every covariate combination</strong> in your dataset, there must be <strong>individuals who sometimes get treatment A and sometimes get treatment B</strong>. Intuitively, this ensures there is enough “experimentation” in the dataset that effects can be estimated.</p>

               style="float:right; padding-left:20px;" width=55%">
</a>
</body>
</html>
<p>As you can imagine, this often does not hold true. Sometimes there are <strong>theoretical positivity violations</strong>: for example, if we are studying the effects of a drug for heart disease, cardiologists might say this drug is never given to people who also have chronic kidney disease because the drug damages the kidneys. The probability of a patient receiving the drug conditional on having kidney disease will be zero in all datasets.</p>
<p>Other times we see <strong>practical positivity violations</strong>, meaning that due to small sample size and/or random chance, there are certain covariate combinations in which few observations receive the treatment of interest in our dataset. Perhaps in a dataset to study the previous example’s heart disease drug, due to random chance, there are no women aged 40-60 years who received the drug in the data. It is not a theoretical positivity violation (i.e. doctors would give the drug to women in this age group), but it is a practical violation nonetheless as it yields small or zero treatment probabilities.</p>
<p>Positivity issues must be addressed, preferably in the planning stage of a study.</p>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;">
Problem #2: Unrealistic Interventions
</h3>
<p>A second problem arises with static interventions: there are many situations in which it is <strong>not realistic to set everyone’s hypothetical exposure to the same value</strong>. Let’s take an example where we are studying the effect of physical activity. A static intervention approach might ask, “<em>what would happen if everyone exercised 30 minutes a week?</em>” Yet there is no actual intervention we could translate to the real world to make everyone exercise 30 minutes a week, i.e. there is no policy a decision-maker could enact to make this happen, even approximately. We could estimate an outcome under this policy, but this unrealistic intervention will likely have a meaningless result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notably, you can have an unrealistic intervention without having a positivity violation. For example, we may have access to a large data set with people of all possible covariate combinations who exercise 30 minutes a week; however, it is still scientifically not meaningful or realistic to evaluate a world in which everyone exercises the exact same amount of time.</p>

</div>
<div id="one-possible-solution-to-the-problems-posed-by-static-interventions-is-dynamic-interventions." class="section level2">
<h2>One possible solution to the problems posed by Static Interventions is Dynamic Interventions.</h2>
<p><strong>Dynamic treatment policies</strong> or interventions ask what would have happened in a hypothetical world where <strong>exposure is assigned based on each observation’s covariate history</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to study the effect of pollution on asthma attacks in the United States. A simple study design could be to find a representative sample of individuals living with asthma, measure their pollution exposure via the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> on one calendar day (along with other confounders), and record whether an asthma attack occurs within a specified time frame.</p>
<p>Although I don’t study pollution, I know it is <strong>scientifically impossible</strong> for everyone in the US to receive the same air quality exposure, even in a world with countless environmental regulations. Natural and geographical forces such as wind, wildfires, elevation, proximity to the ocean, etc. make it <strong>unrealistic to study a single air quality exposure value for everyone</strong>.</p>
<p>We can try getting around these issues by evaluating a dynamic intervention that depends on baseline characteristics of the person or environment. For example, “<em>if a person lives in an urban area, make their AQI exposure 40, and if a person lives in a residential area, make their AQI exposure 20.</em>”</p>

</html>
<p>This intervention may <strong>reduce positivity violations</strong> and <strong>lead to a more realistic study</strong>, yet there are <strong>many other interesting questions</strong> about air pollution <strong>we still cannot answer</strong> with dynamic treatment policies.</p>
<h3 style="color: #C41E3A;">
Problem #3: Static and dynamic interventions cannot depend on the observed exposure
</h3>
<p>Another <strong>key limitation</strong> with both static and dynamic interventions is that the <strong>hypothetical exposure value is completely determined by each observation’s baseline characteristics</strong> rather than the observed exposure. However, there are many <strong>interesting scientific questions</strong> about interventions that <strong>depend on the actual exposure received</strong>. For example, a more relevant question for our pollution example could be, “<em>what would have happened in a hypothetical world where everyone’s AQI exposure was 10% lower than what we observed?</em>” Or, “<em>what if the reduction had been 20 units for individuals living in an area with a daily AQI &gt; 100?</em>”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What questions, or hypothetical interventions, would we propose if we did not feel limited by statistical methodology?</p>

<h1>Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs)</h1>
<p>We can solve all three problems mentioned above with <strong>Modified Treatment Policies (MTPs)</strong>. MTPs describe <strong>hypothetical interventions which depend on the observed value of treatment</strong>, possibly in addition to baseline characteristics. We already mentioned two potential MTPs for our pollution example: “<em>what if we reduced everyone’s AQI exposure by 20%?</em>” and “<em>what if we reduced individuals living in an area with a daily AQI &gt; 100 by 20 units?</em>”</p>

<p>Other interesting MTPs unrelated to pollution might be questions along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How would recovery rates change if we decreased surgery times for surgeries lasting longer than four hours?</em></li>
<li><em>How would diabetes incidence rates change if everyone with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 lowered their BMI by 2 units?</em></li>
<li><em>How would medical school admission rates change if all students with MCAT scores less than 500 increased their score by 5 points?</em></li>

<p><strong>MTPs are an excellent solution</strong> for getting around positivity issues to analyze <strong>more feasible and realistic interventions</strong>. Hopefully this list inspires you to think of MTPs relevant to your own field of study!</p>

<div id="a-general-and-unifying-framework-extending-to-longitudinal-settings" class="section level1">
<h1>A general and unifying framework extending to longitudinal settings</h1>
<p>MTPs for cross-sectional, or point-treatment, studies have actually been <strong>generalized to exposures and covariates measured at multiple time points</strong>, i.e. longitudinal studies. We will refer to this generalization as <strong>Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies (LMTPs)</strong>, to which there is a corresponding <code>R</code> package called <code>lmtp</code>.</p>
<div id="longitudinal-data-analysis-complexities" class="section level2">
<h2>Longitudinal data analysis complexities</h2>
<p>Longitudinal studies pose certain crucial and often-overlooked issues, most notably time-dependent confounders. <strong>Time-dependent confounders are variables which change over time, affect the likelihood of both future exposure and the outcome, and are affected by previous exposure.</strong></p>
<p>A key time-dependent confounder for the relationship between pollution and asthma attacks could be weather. Hot, humid air causes air quality to decrease, and it also aggravates pulmonary conditions like asthma. I will explain time-dependent confounders more in later posts of this series, but for now, note that <strong>LMTP</strong> (the method and <code>R</code> package) <strong>properly accommodates time-dependent confounders.</strong></p>

<li><em>How would drug overdose numbers change if Naloxone access laws were implemented one year later?</em></li>
<li><em>How would length of intubation for intubated COVID-19 patients change if patients who never received steroids were given a standard dose of steroids upon intubation? (Death of other causes is a competing risk and discharge is an informative loss to follow up.)</em>
