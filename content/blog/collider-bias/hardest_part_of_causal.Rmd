> This post outlines the difference between two distinct parts of causal inference --  *identification* and *estimation* -- and provides a strategy for reading a new paper on causal inference.

I love to read new (and old!) papers in the causal inference literature because it helps me do better medical research as an applied biostatistician. However, a few years ago I was really struggling to make headway when I'd pick up new papers. I had no big picture understanding of the causal inference literature.

<!-- It wasn't the jargon or notation that specifically overwhelmed me (although that's definitely a barrier for beginners learning about causal inference!), but rather I had no clear "big picture" view. I was collecting a lot of small pieces of information, but I was missing how they all fit together. -->

In this post I want to share a strategy that greatly improved my ability to read a new causal inference paper. The framework I'll discuss contains none of my own thoughts or opinions, I've just tried to summarize it in a way that I would have understood best as a new learner. Please see my references at the end for a formal description of all of these topics.

The key idea is that causal inference can be thought of as two very distinct halves: **identification** and **estimation.** 

# Identification and Estimation: Keep 'em Separate!

![identification figure]()

Identification is the process of using 

really easy point to miss when you're first learning causal inference. It is the idea that you should always **keep identification separate from estimation** when you're reading a new topic in causal inference.

Of course there are exceptions. Notably, Miguel Hernan and James Robins recently published *What If* book is written for a beginner audience. 

1. What **causal estimand** is this paper concerned with?

2. What **assumptions** are needed to **identify** this causal estimand as a statistical estimand?

3. What **estimator** is the paper proposing for the statistical estimand?

4. How does this estimator **compare** to other estimators to estimate the same statistical estimand?

## Causal Estimand

**Causal estimand:** a quantity that exists in some hypothetical world where you can administer multiple interventions, or treatments, and then observe the outcome under all of those interventions.

*Alternative names:* causal parameter, functional.

*Examples:* Average Treatment Effect


1. Causal inference has been in development by a *ton* of different fields (economics, epidemiology, computer science, statistics) and has just recently begun to explode. 

Here's a list of some estimands discussed in the causal inference literature:



> I believe the key to learning (and applying) causal inference is to always keep **identification** separate from **estimation**.
Now what does *that* mean!? Broadly, **identification means figuring out whether you can write a causal estimand of interest in terms of data** (i.e., in forms of expectations of random variables).

A **causal estimand** is just some summary quantity that would be interesting to evaluate in the system you're studying. A few common causal estimands are the Average Treatment Effect and the Conditional Average Treatment Effect. There are many, many more though, such as the Dose Response Curve, Causal Odds Ratio, Causal Risk Ratio, and Marginal Structural Model.

To determine whether you can identify your causal estimand of interest in your system of study and with the data you have, careful thought is required. It's the stage of a problem when you, as a statistician, sit down and talk with subject matter experts about the precise question they'd like to answer. You may draw *Directed Acyclic Graphs* (DAGs) or *Single World Intervention Graphs* (SWIGs), or write out the *Non Parametric Structural Causal Equations* of the system.

These tools will help you evaluate some of the main requirements of causal inference: for the causal estimand of interest to be identified, you must satisfy causal assumptions of *positivity*, *exchangeability*, and *ignorability*, while still avoiding the usual pitfalls in statistics like *selection bias* and *unmeasured confounding*.

You'll eventually determine whether the causal estimand is possible to write out in terms of your data. For example, if your goal is to identify the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), i.e. the mean difference in outcomes between the treated and untreated in a hypothetical world where everyone *could* get each treatment $A$, your identification of the ATE, $\theta$, may look like:

$\theta = E_W[E[Y|A=1,W]-E[Y|A=0,W]]$

where $W$ is a vector of confounding variables that affect both $A$ and $Y$.

Once 

Everything I've mentioned so far is part of the **identification** side of causal inference. I think of it as the non-data side, because we are not yet dealing with data when we think about the study design, causal estimand, and whether the causal conditions are reasonable to assume. You should never be thinking about **estimation methods** until you've determined whether your causal estimand can be identified.

Once you've *identified* your WHAT, or your estimand of interest, then you can start thinking about HOW you're going to *estimate* that estimand. There are many statistical estimation methods to estimate the same causal effect of interest.

My favorite way to think about this is through a little graph like this. On the left, there are three causal estimands, or estimands of interest. On the top, we can see six different ways you might try to estimate any of these causal estimands of interest. Each of the estimation methods have pros and cons. 

$Odds ratio = E[Y]$

$Relative risk = E[Y]$

$\mathrm{ATE} = E[Y]$


<!-- # An aside: working through the different notation -->

<!-- Causal inference is a rapidly developing field, and there are people working on methods in many different domains (statistics, epidemiology, economics, computer science, to name a few) speaking different jargons. Even *within* fields people call the same idea by many different names, and there is no common mathematical notation, making it really hard for a beginner to know where to start. -->

<!-- Anyways, if you think learning causal inference is hard, it's because it is :-) Luckily I think that will change in the coming years as more books aimed at beginners start to get published. In the meantime, I thought I'd share a high-level organizational map of causal inference that's really helped me learn. -->


<!-- Some of the reasons the causal inference literature is difficult to just pick up and learn is because . Even within the field of statistics, there are some very distinct "lineages" of methodology (e.g. Robins, Pearl, and Rubin), which makes even the starting frameworks really hard to translate when you're a beginner. -->

<!-- It's no secret that causal inference is a rapidly developing field. If you're tried to learn pieces of causal inference already (rightly so!) that it can be pretty difficult.  -->
