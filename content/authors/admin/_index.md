I am a Research Biostatistician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who is passionate about meaningful, reproducible medical research. In addition to my research collaborations, I help teach courses in the [Biostatistics and Data Science MS program](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/graduate-education-clinical-training/masters-track/biostatistics-data-science) and manage the [Biostatistics Computing Club](https://wcm-computing-club.github.io/).

This website is primarily for my blog -- most of my posts are about statistics, programming, or the role of the statistician in healthcare.
