&lt;script src=&#34;https://khstats.com/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s been over a year and a half since I began this blog with my, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl-biostats/&#34;&gt;“A Day in the Life of a Biostatistician”&lt;/a&gt; post. To my surprise, it is hands-down the post I receive the most emails about. I really enjoy hearing from everyone who reaches out, but I thought I’d give detailed answers to the most common questions I’ve received in this follow up post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat all my answers with “this is just one early-career biostatistician’s opinion,” please!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you recommend majoring in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still early in your undergraduate education, I think it is best to major in statistics or math and supplement those classes with specific applications of statistics that interest you. Courses in biological science (e.g. genetics) or issues in healthcare (e.g. medical ethics, health economics) are all beneficial if you’re specifically interested in medical and biological applications of statistics. Any computer science courses you’re able to fit into your schedule will also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re too far along in your current degree or you already finished college, not to worry! Depending on how much time you have before you apply to school, you should take Calculus I-III and Linear Algebra equivalents. This is a pretty standard requirement for most M.S. programs. I wish I had also taken a class in mathematical proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you find the transition from biological sciences to statistics to be difficult?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(For those who haven’t read my DITL post, I majored in Biochemistry and had not taken the prerequisite math courses since my freshman year of college.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. I don’t want to scare anyone away from going into biostatistics, but it was a difficult transition for me and required a lot of effort to catch up. I underestimated the transition to learn graduate level statistics after a years-long hiatus from math. I had to relearn many concepts from calculus and teach my brain to learn high-level math after years of studying biology. I say this not to discourage you(!), but so that you understand you may feel very behind when you first begin your journey in biostatistics. It doesn’t mean you cannot or will not be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know how to code before you started school and did you find learning to code to be difficult?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I didn’t know how to code at all before starting graduate school (you might be reading this thinking, &lt;em&gt;why did anyone let her in?!&lt;/em&gt; and I honestly don’t know, either). I did not find learning to code particularly easy at first, but once I got over the initial learning curve after a few months in school, I found learning to code much easier than statistical theory. This might be because there’s a ton of resources to learn to code online, whereas math is usually harder to find good resources to learn independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have advice on [insert school name here]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like i’m in a position to give advice on specific programs as I only applied to one program, and my reason was purely financially-based. If I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; applied to multiple schools I would’ve still tried to minimize post-school debt. Also, grad school can be very stressful, so pick a school that is in either a location you think you’ll enjoy living, and/or where you will have a good support system around you. I would also recommend trying to talk to current students beforehand if you’re deciding between multiple schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m starting a Masters in Biostatistics soon. Do you have advice for grad school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what worked for me… take from it what you want! I have a lot of advice because I learned a lot of things the hard way. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask a lot of questions or to be a regular presence at office hours. I found that even when I was struggling quite a bit, professors wanted to help me when they saw I was putting in the effort to understand. It can be stressful to ask questions that you think you probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to, but I always thought, “I’d rather ask this to my professor than not know it in front of my future boss.” Plus, you might need letters of recommendations or references, so you want your professors to be able to speak to your personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to strike a good balance between learning to code and learning the theory. I attended a theory-heavy program (a one-credit SAS coding class comprised my entire formal programming education) so I spent a lot of time learning to code on my own, especially in the summer between my first and second years. It seems like more schools are shifting to an applied curriculum, so if you attend one of those programs, I would put independent effort into understanding the underlying theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found it helpful to get to know everyone in my cohort. Being on friendly terms with classmates benefited me on countless occasions throughout my Masters and afterwards. I understand it can be tough to put yourself out there, but it really will make your life easier when you’re stuck on a homework question or just generally feeling overwhelmed by school. My motto was always, “everyone here is likely awkward because we’ve all decided to study statistics, so I really have nothing to lose by ‘making the first move’ towards friendly conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t obsess over grades. I did this a little when I was in school and it was a complete waste of time. No one asked for my grades when I applied for jobs. Focus on learning the concepts and being able to explain what you’ve learned to audiences with varying degrees of technical background. Grades are an imperfect measure of your learning (and to be completely honest, they are often skewed due to a portion of students having materials from previously taught courses) so use them as feedback rather than an absolute measure of success. I TA now and it drives me &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; when students obsess over a less-than-perfect grade rather than their less-than-perfect understanding of a concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize this enough: don’t question your abilities if concepts don’t seem to come as “naturally” as they do for your classmates, especially if they’ve taken more quantitative courses than you (e.g. math, stats, computer science, engineering majors). They’ve probably already seen the foundation of what you’re learning in various forms before, and that matters &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;! It took me a while to realize this, and I wasted a lot of time worrying I’d never be a good statistician because I had to study so much longer to understand concepts at even a passing level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I do an internship during grad school? Do you have any advice on getting an internship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, apply to internships! I applied to several for the summer between my first and second year of my Masters. There is a downside that they often don’t pay that well, and it can be costly to live in a new city for just 2-3 months. I ended up not taking any of my internship offers for that reason, and ultimately doing summer research in a lab at my university. I don’t think this hurt my final job prospects at all. My advice for getting internships is to review your CV/cover letter with your school’s career counselors, and then apply early and often. If you don’t have any relevant work experience (I didn’t), highlight in your cover letter and CV how your projects in school thus far have prepared you to do good work as an intern. For example, I discussed the dataset we used in my first semester regression course as a way of highlighting applied skills (exploratory data analysis, assumptions of regression, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for summer research, it worked for me to email professors explaining that I was interested in their research and asking if we could set up a time to briefly chat. I used to get really nervous for these meetings before someone informed me that pretty much all professors &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to talk about their research. Even if they don’t have any research opportunities at the moment, it’s a good way to learn about aspects of biostatistics you didn’t know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel intellectually stimulated as a biostatistician?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. This is, hands down, the reason I like biostatistics so much. I will never know all there is to know about biostatistics (not even close!) and there are so many directions to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel financially rewarded as a biostatistician?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yes. I’ve been able to live comfortably and save money while working in academic research right out of school (we notoriously make lower salaries than positions in pharmaceutical or tech companies). If you’re curious about specific salaries, you might like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/08/01/mastergraduate/&#34;&gt;recent ASA survey of (bio)statistics graduates&lt;/a&gt;. Note that when you’re looking at salaries online, you can also look at jobs with the title “data scientist,” which you should have the base qualifications for after you receive a Masters in (Bio)statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think a PhD is necessary for your career growth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m 2.5 years into my career and don’t yet feel stunted, so that’s a good sign, I think! No, I don’t think a PhD is necessary to have a stable, rewarding career. This is not to say I’ll never apply, because I do really love learning new statistical theory, but I do not think it is necessary and can see many routes to having a “successful” career without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite part of your job? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love when I am able to focus on one project and optimize my code to be really well documented and efficient. I also like improving my understanding of the biology or clinical domain knowledge for specific projects. Interestingly, one of my least favorite parts of the job &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be writing and editing manuscripts, but as I’ve gained experience reading and writing scientific papers, I enjoy this much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your least favorite part of your job? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is working with those who either 1) think they have equivalent knowledge to me in statistics after taking one or two introductory statistics courses or 2) know very little about statistics and do not see a value in learning more. Both types of people tend to want to be very hands-on in my analyses and this usually results in me explaining (to little avail) why we cannot do what they think we should do. I don’t think this is unique to my job, or academia, or even statistics, however, it is definitely my least favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now! I hope it is helpful. As always feel free to reach out if you have other questions; I try to answer my messages to this &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:kathoffman.stats@gmail.com&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; once a week. You can also read about my friend Kim’s career as a biostatistician at a pharmaceutical CRO in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl/pharma-cro/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the Sidelines: NYC&#39;s COVID-19 Outbreak from the Eyes of a Pulmonary and Critical Care Team&#39;s Biostatistician</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://khstats.com/rmarkdown-libs/pagedtable/js/pagedtable.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal narrative about my experience on the data analytics side of NYC’s COVID-19 outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 15, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt; My coworker is moving to California. She’s a statistician for a group of pulmonary and critical care physicians at our New York City hospital, and I’m a statistician who’s trying not to do too many things wrong, only three months into my first job out of school. “I think you’d be good with this research team,” she tells me. “There’s some really interesting studies on lung diseases.” I nod, because that’s what you do when you’ve been at your job for three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take over her projects and start learning organ failure scoring systems, criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the differences between invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. My close friend does cutting-edge cancer statistics, and I feel a bit resentful. Nobody ever wants to hear about the controversial definitions of sepsis at family parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the months pass by, I slowly build my mental encyclopedia and begin to embrace my role as a pulmonary and critical care biostatistician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 5th, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; A full year and three months later, I wake up very sick. It is the kind of sick where you can’t do anything but curl up on your bathroom floor and let &lt;em&gt;being sick&lt;/em&gt; consume you. Too sick to read, too sick to sleep. I spike a fever and can hardly move for two days before I hobble to the doctor’s office and nearly faint mid-exam. The doctor insists I stay until I drink an entire bottle of water. “Is there anyone to check on you at home?” he asks, concerned. No, no, I’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week my fever breaks and I’m back to work. It’s early March, so “Coronavirus?!” is everyone’s first question. They’re all joking, except the pulmonologists I work with. Nothing respiratory, I assure them. One isn’t convinced. “Some young people are getting ‘silent hypoxia.’ It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to have COVID-19 with no respiratory symptoms at all,” she tells me. Months later, I’ll read that as the headline of various news articles, but the time, no testing is available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 17, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Barely two weeks pass before the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases explode in New York City. Restaurants are instructed to close the day before Saint Patrick’s Day, my birthday. I can’t meet up with my friends anymore, so I cook macaroni and cheese and run to Central Park to watch the sun set behind skyscrapers. My grandparents call me and they make &lt;em&gt;Happy Birthday&lt;/em&gt; sound like a hymn from a Catholic mass and I laugh, and it is the only part of my day that feels like every other birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m leaving the park, my mom texts me that she hopes I had a good day. Any other year it would be strange for her to nearly miss my birthday, but this year she is working long hours. She’s a nursing director back in Michigan and her hospital is already preparing for their own impending COVID-19 outbreak. The preparations will not be in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I jog home, I pass a sign asking former healthcare workers to volunteer to take care of NYC COVID-19 patients. Before I began my career in biostatistics, I worked at a hospital caring for acutely ill patients, so I sign up without hesitation. My misguided logic is that the exploding numbers of COVID-19 cases will make my critical care collaborators too busy to pursue their research, and this seems like the best way for me to help as the world descends into chaos. While I fill out the online contact form, I wonder what it will feel like to take care of patients again. I look up YouTube videos to refresh myself on drawing blood and inserting IVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How absolutely crazy that I thought my biostatistics training wouldn’t be useful, in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 22, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a pulmonary and critical care team’s statistician so &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; I am one of the first analysts at my hospital pulled into COVID-19 work. It starts with a text on a Sunday – the first of many – from a pulmonologist. “Do we have a data dictionary for our ICU database, Kat?” Our informatics team is using the structure of the ICU database I work with as part of a COVID-19 tracking repository for our entire hospital. Within days, I am told to drop all of my other research projects for COVID-19 work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first request for me is straightforward: summarize the laboratory results from our first 300 COVID-19 patients. 300 patients at our hospital! That’s insane, I think to myself. It seems only a week ago the news reports said there were 300 people in the entire city with COVID-19. I begin working through issues linking the databases, identifying missing information, and explaining critical care jargon to other analysts. Each morning I pull new data and watch the files grow exponentially larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless questions flooding in from all over the hospital. Most of them revolve around “who will get intubated, and when?” My hospital, like so many other hospitals in NYC, is on track to run out of ventilators soon. My attendance becomes mandatory at multiple “risk prediction” meetings each week. I find myself in charge of extensive data cleaning and then writing code for models to answer vague and terrifying questions: we need to figure out which patients will “crash,” who can be transferred, and, if we run out of ventilators, who has the best chance to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a junior researcher, previously unconcerned with hospital operations, suddenly confronted with the task of providing rapid answers for potentially immediate decision making. I accept my new role with the utmost seriousness. My days, normally spent coding with double monitors at a proper desk, suddenly fill with Zoom meetings from 8:30-5:00 from a laptop at my kitchen table. Each night after the meetings end, I take advantage of the relative quiet to code into the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks I use the long, uninterrupted hours of weekends to work, waking up with the sun and continuing on until at least 11pm, with few breaks in between. On some nights I send my mom “good morning” texts at 5am. “Are you waking up early or have you not slept yet?” is always her first question. The next is, “No fever? No cough?” She is worried about me, living in the international epicenter, but I’m just as worried about her, working at a hospital every day. She informs me that my dad is sleeping in my old bedroom in case she brings the virus home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitals around the city begin to call me, wanting to know if I can still help care for COVID-19 patients as a former healthcare worker. “I want to but I can’t, I’m so sorry, I’m helping with COVID data now.” It sounds and feels inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; My best friend and her sister are also nurses in Michigan. I FaceTime her to check in. She and her sister’s units have become “hot floors”: every room is filled with a COVID-19 patient. They were living with their parents, another sister, uncle, and cousins, but both have moved to an AirBnb for the foreseeable future. “It’s so crazy here, Kitty,” she tells me in a defeated voice. At the time, Michigan’s case trajectory is second only to New York’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her nursing friends has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and is on 6 Liters of oxygen. I can’t help but think about the prediction models I’ve been working on. I mentally run his characteristics through them. I know what my models would estimate his probability of intubation to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to her talk about the N-95 masks they’ve been given. “Remember how they used to say those were one-time use?” she asks me. I do. “They started telling us they were good for the whole day, and then they said they’d be good for the whole week, and now they’re saying we might have to start sharing.” I wonder what data analyst, perhaps just like me, is crunching those numbers and feeding the information to hospital administration. “The virus is so terrible. I’ve never done so much post-mortem care, zipped so many body bags…” Her voice drifts off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty, on the sidelines. I see the raccoon eyes – the only part of their faces visible between hair caps and procedure masks – of the physicians I spend all day hopping on and off meetings with, and I desperately want to help. I cannot hold the hand of a COVID-19 patient but I have all their data at my keystrokes: millions of lab results, vital signs, and procedure codes. I see their inflammatory cytokines spike, I watch their oxygen levels plummet, I can tell you which organs are failing, who’s on which experimental drug, and who’s just been made Do Not Intubate and Do Not Resuscitate. I follow in horror, almost in real-time, the time-stamps of admission, intubation, death. I cannot compare this experience to physically caring for COVID-19 patients, but I feel haunted by it all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hole up in my tiny studio in Manhattan for days at a time, listening to the wails of ambulances and pings of messages from my computer. I see only one friend with any frequency; we both live alone, 18 blocks from each other. She texts me often, asking to meet in Central Park. She suspects I am not doing well, and she is right. I walk with her all over the Upper East Side a few times a week, each of us donned in our black cotton masks. We try not to talk about COVID-19, but it’s hard to avoid when our walks take us past the pop-up ICU tents and refrigerated trucks that stretch entire blocks – the overflow morgues for NYC’s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to time our walks so that we’re outside at 7pm, when the city unites to cheer for healthcare workers. If I’m not out walking with her, I climb religiously onto my fire escape every night to clap. Sometimes a man in the apartment across the street sings Sinatra. &lt;em&gt;I want to wake up in the city that never sleeps… New York, New York!&lt;/em&gt; I’ve only lived here two years, but I miss “the city that never sleeps” so badly that it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life continues in this way for me, with no real sense of time or distinguishing events, from mid March until early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; It is Mother’s Day, and my 50th straight day of working with COVID-19 data. At 11pm, my cell phone goes off. It is an ominous vibration against my kitchen table, where I am perpetually sitting with my laptop whirring. “Hi Honey… I just wanted to let you know that, mmm…” it’s my mom, and her voice is cracking. I finish the sentence for her, “Aunt Peggy died?” I ask, sadly. “Yes.” “Okay. Thanks for letting me know.” I stare into the white brick wall in front of my kitchen table for so long that I start seeing multicolored spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather’s eldest sister, my Aunt Peggy, had begun showing telltale symptoms of COVID-19 and tested positive only a few days previously. She’d been without any visitors in her assisted living home for months due to isolation restrictions. She was royalty in our family; the red-lipsticked, always fashionably late, prized guest at every family party. She had an unforgettable, incredibly sweet voice, and I can still hear her words to me last Christmas. “How’s &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;, Katherine? I’m so proud of you.” She was the first nurse in my family, and she influenced my mom to become a nurse, who influenced me to pursue medical research. The matriarch of our family left us on Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend the night trying to find a rental car company that will allow me to drive one-way from New York to Michigan. It can’t be done; I am several weeks too late in my exodus from the city. I book a flight instead and leave a few days later on a near-empty plane to spend time with my family. I plan to stay in Michigan for two weeks, but I don’t leave for two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 20, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; The leaves I watched bud in Central Park during my walks this spring are changing to red and gold. As I write this, I think of countless other ways I could attempt to explain what my tiny corner of the world was like during NYC’s outbreak. Most are too personal to ever record. At the same time, it is difficult to share even the memories I have, partially because I know they are incomparable to the frontline workers’ who risked their lives everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences living and working in Manhattan during March, April, and May will stick with me forever. I hope there comes a day that I can meet in real life – mask free – all the analysts, hospital administrators, physicians, residents, fellows, medical students, and data engineers I conversed with so frequently during the height of the outbreak. At the same time, I hope we never have to work together again. It is a wish that I fear will not come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this past week I attended a meeting with our Informatics team. “It’s good to ‘see’ everyone,” someone said. It’s only half true; the circumstances that bring us to meetings together are never good. We discussed data structures for a possible second wave of COVID-19 in NYC as schools and indoor dining reopen. After the call, I felt an immense sadness, despite being in a much better place than when I left the city in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of my heart, I don’t know if I can handle another round of it all. Can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/img/kim1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wrote my first blog post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl-biostats/&#34;&gt;“A Day in the Life of a Biostatistician,”&lt;/a&gt; documenting the granular details of my work as an early career academic research biostatistician. I’m excited to announce I am turning that post into a “day in the life” series in which I interview other biostatisticians with differing roles. My hope is that it will enlighten anyone interested in the field of biostatistics, and especially help undergraduate and current biostatistics Masters students make informed decisions about their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first interviewee is Kim Hirschhorn, a former classmate and good friend from my time at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Kim is an avid reality TV show watcher, loves Eggo waffles and Hostess Ho-Hos, and is a great statistician; so great, professors were often confused as to why she wasn’t planning to pursue a PhD. Kim, however, has always been adamant that she doesn’t need a PhD to have the career she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim’s determination to find a job which allowed for ample career growth with “only” an MS in Biostatistics paid off. After graduating in 2018, she chose to work as a biostatistician at PRA Health Sciences, a Contract Research Organization (CRO) for pharmaceutical companies. Biostatistician roles at CROs offer excellent career trajectory for Masters-level statisticians and don’t have a job title ceiling as some careers in statistics notoriously do for those without a PhD. Additionally, it’s a lucrative job option for a Masters-level biostatistician. (🤑!) For more information on salaries of early career statisticians you can check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/08/01/mastergraduate/&#34;&gt;American Statistical Association’s recent survey of 2018 Masters in Statistics graduates&lt;/a&gt;. But, to learn more about what Kim actually does as a biostatistician at a pharmaceutical CRO, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kat: Thanks for taking the time to chat, Kim! Can you tell me where you work and what the mission of your company is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kim: I work at the Chicago office of a large CRO called PRA Health Sciences. PRA stands for Pharmaceutical Research Associates, and our primary responsibility is to run clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies. This includes everything from planning the study at an administrative level – such as identifying physicians to recruit patients and administer drug therapies – to collecting data like patients’ disease progression and adverse events, analyzing and summarizing the results, and submitting requests for the successful trials to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After a pharmaceutical company has researched and developed a potential new drug, we partner with them to implement the various phases of clinical trials necessary to test that drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoa, sometimes I forget about all the steps in a clinical trial. Before we go any further, can you give us a quick explanation about what those phases of clinical trials mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three main phases: Phase I, II, and III. In general, Phase I clinical trials check whether a drug is safe to administer. Sometimes this also involves testing which dosage of a drug is safe – or at least not overwhelmingly toxic – to the body. Phase I trials are usually done on a small group of patients. Phase II trials are done on a larger group of patients and focus on whether the drug is effective, or in other words, whether it can actually fix whatever health problem the pharmaceutical company had in mind when developing it. Most drugs fail in Phase II.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a drug does move onto a Phase III trial, its performance in comparison to the current standard of care (which is often another drug on the market) is evaluated. In both Phase II and III, patients are randomized into treatment and control groups and typically neither physicians nor patients know which treatment is administered. Even patients who are not receiving a treatment will receive a sugar pill, or placebo drug. Oftentimes a clinical trial’s aims will fall somewhere between two phases. For example, I’ve worked on Phase 1b/2a trials that collect information on safety, determine the recommended dose, and then evaluate the drug’s efficacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see, so which of those phases do you work on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been a Biostatistician I for a bit over a year now, so that means I am the lead biostatistician on a few simple Phase I trials. There is usually not much statistical testing occurring here; it’s all about how many patients have an adverse response to the drug. Since I am still in the most junior biostatistician role, a lot of my time is spent doing biostatistical support for Phase II and III trials, where more senior biostatisticians oversee my work and pre-specify the analyses. The longer I stay at my job, the more responsibilities I will have and the more complex studies I will lead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s involved in leading a study, even a “small and simple” phase I? How is that different from the work you do as “biostatistical support” on the Phase II and III trials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I am the lead of a study, I am meeting with members of the pharmaceutical company and working with them to develop a statistical analysis plan. Once the clinical trial starts and I begin to receive data, I work with programmers to ensure everything that needs to be done for the analysis is completed in the time allotted by that trial’s budget. Since the studies I am leading now are early phase, I am in charge of doing all the statistical analyses and reporting the results back to the pharmaceutical company. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, when I am biostatistical support, I am mostly executing analyses already specified in a statistical analysis plan. This typically involves writing macros in the statistical programming language &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/stat.html&#34;&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt; to ultimately produce what is dozens of outputs. A large portion of my time as a junior biostatistician is spent figuring out the best way to present that huge amount of data and results in a comprehensible way. Even before I have data from a clinical trial, I have to plan out detailed tables and prepare a shell document for when the data is ready for analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you working with in your day-to-day roles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I get assignments from my manager, and then work with the lead biostatisticians on each trial. It is standard in the pharmaceutical industry that all analyses must be independently reproduced. This usually means the lead biostatistician is redoing my analysis without looking at my code, so sometimes I have to work closely with him or her to figure out why our results are not matching. Besides that, I frequently collaborate with the data programmers and statistical programmers in charge of the data for the trials I am working on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data programmers are in charge of taking raw data from the trials, checking it for inconsistencies, and putting it into a standardized form for statistical programmers. Statistical programmers then take those standardized data sets, derive many new variables from those initially collected for each patient, and produce hundreds of tables and figures summarizing the data. In some cases they also help prepare the data for my analyses, for example, they might write code to calculate the number of days or months until each patient experienced disease progression so that I can use that information for statistical models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If there is a problem with the data when I am running a model, I ask the statistical programmer to check his or her code, and if there is no issue there, the data programmer looks at their code. If necessary, the data programmer may go back to the clinical sites who are collecting the data from patients and ask them to correct any missing information or inconsistencies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like your data is in pretty good shape when it arrives to you, then!
Earlier you mentioned writing macros in SAS. Does everyone use SAS? Could you use R or another programming language if you wanted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have used R for a few side analyses, such as a data mining analysis. However, the industry standard for pharmaceuticals has always been SAS. I don’t foresee that changing anytime soon. Although a huge benefit of R is that it is free and open source software, meaning anyone can contribute code in a package, SAS has the advantage that if you run a certain type of statistical model, you can be absolutely sure that is what ran on your data. Because SAS is a paid software, it is liable for what it says it is doing, and there is always support on hand if you have questions about errors or results you are getting from any given data procedure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your hours like? What sort of flexibility do you have for vacation, or working remotely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I usually get in at 8:15 and leave somewhere between 4:45 and 5:15. I do get a lot of vacation days, with the caveat that if there is a deliverable deadline for a project I’m working on, I may not be able to take my vacation during that time. As for working remotely, it’s an option I have as-needed, such as if I have a doctor’s appointment. The job can definitely be done 100% remotely, and in fact many members of the company work remotely, but it’s not really an option for a Biostatistician I to do all the time because we rely so heavily on our senior biostatisticians. I prefer that, though - it’s easier for me to work in the office!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will your roles and responsibilities change as you progress as a biostatistician at a CRO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I said a lot of my time is spent working on table shells and report planning, I think it’s worth acknowledging that that is not a very exciting activity. However, as a Biostatistician I progresses to Biostatistician II, Senior Biostatistician, Principal Biostatistician, Senior Principal Biostatistician, etc., a lot of those more mundane (in my opinion) tasks decrease. You are in charge of much more complex studies and specifying the statistical analyses for that clinical trial. The work also naturally becomes more managerial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being in charge of a trial means meeting with both external clients and internal company leadership, setting timelines for data/statistical programmers and junior biostatisticians, answering questions that come up about data and analyses, maintaining oversight of the hours each team member is spending on the project, and tracking the corresponding budget carefully. As biostatisticians progress in the career ladder at a CRO, they have some flexibility in how much data they actually analyze on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to take this position at a CRO over your other offers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well of course it’s not all about money, but this was one of the highest offers I received, so that helped. The potential for career growth was also very appealing to me. Typically after about 4-5 years you are a Senior Biostatistician and qualified to lead any study. But, you can lead studies long before this if the pharmaceutical company agrees you are qualified to do so. I really like that career progression at a pharmaceutical CRO is very much about experience and skills, as opposed to whether or not you hold a PhD. This is often not the case if you work directly for a pharmaceutical company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, what made you choose to enter the field of Biostatistics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have always been drawn to a career in public health. During my first year at the University of Illinois, I was a stereotypical freshman pre-med student. I ultimately changed my mind about medical school and got a Bachelor’s degree in statistics, but I still took several epidemiology and biology classes just because I found them interesting. Math has always been my strongest subject, but I wanted to find a way to combine it with my other interests. After doing a fair share of Googling, I found the field of Biostatistics. I met with the head of U of I’s Statistics MS program, and he shared his experience of working in industry as a biostatistician before becoming a professor. He spoke very highly of the field and gave me a lot of great information on the types of careers I could have with a Masters in Statistics or Biostatistics. I was pretty much sold after that meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking back, are you happy with your decision to do a Masters in Biostatistics, rather than Statistics or Applied Statistics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, I’m really happy I decided on a Masters in Biostatistics. Throughout my program, our applied problem sets were always related to medicine or healthcare in some way, and it was easy for me to take health-specific statistics classes, such as a clinical trials methodology course. Since I was pretty sure I wanted to go into healthcare, I think biostatistics was a great decision for me, because a Masters in Biostatistics shows my passion for the field and may give me an edge over similar applicants who have a more general Masters in Statistics or Applied Statistics. I still find public health to be the most interesting sector to practice statistics in, so I think the degree will always be to my advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for chatting, Kim!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have other questions for Kim, or if there are careers within biostatistics you’d like to hear about, feel free to email me and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://khstats.com/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It seems fitting that my first blog post is on a topic that I tried and failed to find via Google search a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll back up for a second. A few years ago I was a recent college graduate, and trying hard to “figure out my life.” My major was biochemistry, which is one of those degrees where 99%* of people just keep on going to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/img/ditl/sadcat.png&#34;  width=&#34;48%&#34; alt=&#34;cat&#34; style=&#34;float:right; padding-left:65px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working full-time night-shift at a hospital as a nurse technician. The key word in that sentence is “night-shift” which meant that even on my days off, I didn’t sleep at night, but all my friends and family did. So, I was often alone and awake, with a lot of time to think about my future… and surf the web for potential careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted a job in healthcare, but I was confused as to where in medicine would be a good fit for me. I could visualize very clearly what my days at work would look like if I were to become a physician, or a physician assistant, or a registered nurse (all careers I developed lengthy pros and cons lists for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was another career involving medicine that I was drawn to but didn’t know enough about. “Biostatistics” was a class biochemistry majors took at my university, but I had been exempted because I took AP Statistics in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, biostatistics seemed to be the application of some high school-level math to biological problems. I had no concept of what a degree in biostatistics, and much less a career as a biostatistician, could entail. Endless Google searches with some variant of “what does a biostatistician do” and even “day in the life of a biostatistician” had not given me a very good picture of what I would actually be doing as a biostatistician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ultimately lucked out during a conversation with a professor during my senior year of college. I was rambling about my many life plans and he mentioned his cousin was the chair of a well-known Biostatistics program. He encouraged me to email her my questions about biostatistics, and I am so grateful she took time to respond with detailed answers. Her description of life as a biostatistician was enough for me to choose going to graduate school for an MS in biostatistics over medical school/physician assistant school/second-degree nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel wholeheartedly that although I would have enjoyed my life as an MD/PA/RN, biostatistics is the right career for me. So, in honor of my confused younger self, and as a way of paying it forward, I’ve dedicated this topic for my very first blog post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; padding-bottom: -30px; padding-left: 0px; float: left;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/img/ditl/nursing.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hanging out with my mom (an RN of 41 years and counting!) after a particularly exhausting night shift as a nurse technician.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disclaimer: what follows is a day in the life of one masters-level, academic research-focused biostatistician and I cannot make claims about the careers of statisticians in industry or pharmaceuticals or hospitals or government. In addition, here’s a bit more background before I get into the granular details of my work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My official job description is to assist investigators (i.e. physicians or PhD-level researchers with a scientific question) throughout all stages of the scientific research process. This means helping with study design, data collection, data cleaning (also known as getting the data in the right form for analysis and making sure nothing is obviously incorrect), data visualization, statistical analysis, reporting and explaining my results, and writing methods and results sections for scientific papers. You will soon see that on any given day I am working on multiple projects at various stages of this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will mention R/Rstudio a bit. For those who are not familiar with it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source (which means anyone can help contribute) programming language that is well-equipped for statistical analysis. It’s arguably very similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, which is a more widely used language, but statisticians tend to use R more because its statistical packages are very well-developed. During grad school I used Python because I worked in a computational biology lab, and I learned &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html&#34;&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt; (another statistical programming language) in some of my classes, but R is what I prefer these days. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Rstudio&lt;/a&gt; is a platform that makes it more user friendly to use R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado! An average day**:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/img/ditl/desk.png&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; height=&#34;375px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:30AM&lt;/strong&gt; - I arrive at my office and spend a few minutes chatting with my coworkers. To set the scene for you, I have a fairly spacious cubicle within a group of five other cubicles. I sit next to another research biostatistician, two health informatics professionals, and two clinical trial grant specialists. I’m actually not completely sure what that last pair’s title is, but I know their primary task is to make sure several multi-million dollar clinical trial grants stay funded (woah). Everyone I sit by is young and goofy, but very driven, making for a fun office environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:45AM&lt;/strong&gt; - I check and answer new emails from researchers I collaborate on projects with. I send my availability for a meeting to a group of doctors who want to go over the results of a recent analysis I did on Body Mass Index and death rates in the Intensive Care Unit. In a different thread of emails, I thank several researchers from another university for clarifying their methods and sending me code for an analysis similar to one I will soon work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:00AM&lt;/strong&gt; - I open a manuscript draft for a paper I received yesterday. It’s from a group of residents and medical students I worked with a few months ago. Their study looks at the association between blood levels of a certain biomarker and the time to death in cancer patients. My role in the analysis was to examine the associations between several biomarkers such as phosphorus, phosphate, and calcitriol. I then fit a regression model, just like y=mx+b, but with way more math. For this analysis I used a model for when your y is a time to an event (death, in this case), fittingly called a survival model. After adjusting for confounding factors like age, which affects both tumor progression and biomarker levels, there was a significant association between the biomarker and time to death in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/blog/ditl-biostats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;em&gt;An example of a figure for a manuscript. This particular plot suggests that cancer patients with an elevated biomarker died at a faster rate than patients who did not have an elevated biomarker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have asked for my assistance in writing the methods section. The methods section of a scientific article is the steps the scientists took to analyze data explicitly written out for anyone looking to review or learn about their work. I read through their current draft of the paper carefully, make some edits, and send it back. They are hoping to submit this paper to a peer-reviewed journal within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:45AM&lt;/strong&gt; - I have a weekly meeting a few blocks from my office with a neurologist I spend a large portion of my time working with. She is a leader in the field of Alzheimer’s research, and I find it very rewarding to work on her data and be a small part of a growing body of research in the field. I am “contracted” out to her research as I am to all of the researchers I work with—it’s how my institution budgets funding for grants. One of the faculty-level biostatisticians in my department—which means he has a PhD and specializes in certain statistical methods—is also part of this contract, and some days, like today, he joins me at these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:00AM&lt;/strong&gt; - This week’s meeting is pretty straightforward. We discuss how we can improve one of the neurologist’s National Institute of Health grants from a statistics standpoint. The statistical methods for this project can get complicated, in part because we are looking at the brain scans of women in different stages of menopause over time, and we have to consider age as a confounding factor. We want to convey to the reviewers of our grant how we plan to do this. Since this is a methods-focused meeting, I mostly listen and take notes along with two neurology research coordinators that also attend these weekly meetings. When the meeting concludes I have for less work than usual - I only need to make a few graphs representing our study design and past results for inclusion to the grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoffmakl/khoffman_website/master/content/blog/katalan.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00PM&lt;/strong&gt; - I head to lunch with a group of coworkers. They have gotten food from a nearby salad place, and we sit in one of our favorite buildings on campus and eat together. Our jokes oscillate from incredibly nerdy to pretty stupid. One of my coworkers points out that our hair is styled the same way for the third day in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:45PM&lt;/strong&gt; - I get back to my desk and type up my handwritten notes from the neurology meeting and put them in that project’s “Notes” folder. It’s important to me that I keep track of all my meetings electronically - I fear losing my notebooks or someone else having to decipher my cursive should I ever have to pass off a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://khstats.com/img/ditl/notes.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; style=&#34;float:right; padding-left:25px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00PM&lt;/strong&gt; - I start to make a plan for a different analysis I’m working on. This project is something new for me - it involves a protein assay and data for 1000+ different protein expression levels. The researcher I’m working with wants to know which proteins are over- and under-expressed in people with a specific autoimmune disorder and a certain type of lung disease. I’ve recently spoken to some bioinformaticians and have a clearer idea of the analysis I need to do. I draw out a little map of the code organization I think would be the most efficient for this analysis and open up Rstudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:30PM&lt;/strong&gt; - I get to work writing up functions, which is just a fancy programming way of saying your code can do the same thing to multiple data sets (or subsets of patients, as is the case of this protein expression study I’m doing). Sometimes it takes a bit longer to write my functions than it would if I were to just copy and paste my code several different times, but the final code is much more readable and less prone to errors. By the time I’m done working, I have some interactive plots showing the significant and non-significant results. When you hover over them, they show what protein corresponds to which point on the graph. They look like this, except this is not the real data we used in her study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoffmakl/khoffman_website/master/content/blog/volcano.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Rstudio and its amazing Rmarkdown tool to craft a draft report to the researcher, and I save it with today’s date in my “Reports” folder for that project. The report so far includes unadjusted and adjusted models of all the protein expressions using very small p-values to account for the 1000+ statistical comparisons we’re making. I show the results in various plots such as the one above (called a “volcano plot” for its shape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also started writing code for models to determine which proteins are most different, or uniquely expressed, between subgroups of patients. Tomorrow, I will use a technique common in machine learning, called clustering, to see if these protein expressions can correctly classify subgroups of patients. The goal is to find a minimum group of proteins to identify patients of interest who have both the autoimmune disorder and the lung disease my collaborator is interested in. One way this research could be impactful is that it may help determine which proteins pharmaceuticals should develop drugs to target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I close the report; I will continue working on this analysis tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:45PM&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s time for my last meeting of the day. I head to another floor of my office building and get my laptop set up in a conference room. I await the arrival of several doctors. It will be my first time meeting most of them, and our task today is to discuss the data collection process for a future study involving both genetic mutation data from tumor biopsies and clinical data from electronic health records on thousands of patients with lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00PM&lt;/strong&gt; - The doctors arrive and, after introductions, we talk about the current stage of the project and what the goals are. We discuss the timing of starting chart reviews of patients, how we will upload the information to a database efficiently, and what might be the best way to condense the highly detailed genetics data into useful information for an analysis. Our solution will likely involve a series of iterative searches through the columns containing genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The start of a database I am helping researchers build to collect data for their study. This is not my favorite part of my job, but it is a crucial step for good scientific research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00PM&lt;/strong&gt; - The meeting ends, and I go back to my desk to record more handwritten notes. I log the hours I spent on each project that day into Toggl, which is the time-tracking application our team uses. This is so we know how much time we’re spending on each project, and is as much for our own sake as it is anyone else’s. I update my to-do list, which is a giant color-coded excel spreadsheet, and eat a few chocolate covered raisins as my reward for a productive day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:30PM&lt;/strong&gt; - I leave work! I typically have some kind of activity, like happy hour (see my cute cubicle buddies below), a sports game, or Spanish class that I’m heading off to. Some days I attend coding workshops hosted by groups such as R-ladies. On nights when I’m feeling especially nerdy, I’ll go home and read a statistics paper or sift through the #rstats tips on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…So, there you have it. One average daily experience as an early career masters-level statistician. All in all, I have an excellent work-life balance and overall work environment. Every day I get to learn more about science, medicine, statistics, and the intersection of these wonderful ideas. Although it varies quite a bit, approximately 10% of each day involves writing, 20% interacting with other researchers, and the rest of it is spent thinking critically and finding answers to problems I am passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope if there are any 22, 42, or 14 year-olds out there considering a career in biostatistics and struggling to figure out what on earth we actually do, that you find this post and it lessens your confusion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Not a real statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Exact details and diseases of the studies I am currently working on have been generalized or altered to protect the research interests of my collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
